# 1. In our discussion of abstraction, we talked about how interfaces and modularity can exponentially reduce the maximum complexity of a system. Can you think of any examples from the real world where introducing indirection makes a complex system more manageable?

sockets(electrical) is an abstraction/interfaces between the eletrical devices and the grid.

# 2. What is the motivation behind functions along the lines of getFrequency and setFrequency over just having a public frequency data member?

1. we can conceal how the frequency is implemented; 2. we can do additional checks for the caller's inputs

# 3. When is a constructor invoked? Why are constructors useful?

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-are-constructors-called/
1. Global objects: For a global object, constructor is called before main() is called.
```cpp
Test t1; 
  
int main() { 
    cout << "main() started\n"; 
    return 0; 
}
```

2. Function or Block Scope ( automatic variables and constants ) For a non-static local object, constructor is called when execution reaches point where object is declared. 
```cpp
void fun() { 
  Test t1; 
}
```

3. Class Scope: When an object is created, compiler makes sure that constructors for all of its subobjects (its member and inherited objects) are called.

```cpp
class A 
{ 
public: 
  A(); 
}; 
  
A::A() { 
    cout << "A's Constructor Called \n"; 
} 
  
class B 
{ 
  A t1; 
public: 
  B(); 
}; 
  
B::B() { 
    cout << "B's Constructor Called \n"; 
}
```

4. Dynamic objects: For a dynamically allocated object, constructor is invoked by new operator.
```cpp
Test *t1 = new Test;
```
