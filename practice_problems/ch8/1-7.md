# 1. In our discussion of abstraction, we talked about how interfaces and modularity can exponentially reduce the maximum complexity of a system. Can you think of any examples from the real world where introducing indirection makes a complex system more manageable?

sockets(electrical) is an abstraction/interfaces between the eletrical devices and the grid.

# 2. What is the motivation behind functions along the lines of getFrequency and setFrequency over just having a public frequency data member?

1. we can conceal how the frequency is implemented; 2. we can do additional checks for the caller's inputs

# 3. When is a constructor invoked? Why are constructors useful?
