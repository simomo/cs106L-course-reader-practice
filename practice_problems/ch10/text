# 2. What is an lvalue? An rvalue? Does the + operator yield an lvalue or an rvalue? How about the
pointer dereference operator?

(x) a + b = 1;
so, rvalue.

(/) *a = 1;
so, lvalue.

# 3. Are overloaded operators inherently more efficient than regular functions?

I don't think so.

# 4. Explain how to implement operator + in terms of operator += 

```cpp
const SomeType SomeType::operator+ (int other) {
    return this->operator+=(other);
}
```
