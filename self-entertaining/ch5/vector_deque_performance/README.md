# `vector` vs `deque`

```
insert:
       vector:     14.333
        deque:      0.013
push_back:
       vector:      0.007
        deque:      0.006
random access:
       vector:      0.002
        deque:      0.015
iterator:
       vector:      0.001
        deque:      0.014
```

# `deque` is pronounced "deck"
