# How to write programs

The "snake", an example for vector usage in the CS160L, shows me what the best practice is while write a complex program. Here is my notes.

## 1. Understand the problem we want to solve

## 2. According your understanding of the problem, build the (core) data structure(s) to represent "the problem world"

## 3. Build a skeleton(framework) which is around the data structure(s) and contains all necessry *high-level* steps to resolve the issue

## 4. Divide each *high-level* steps into sub steps, then implement them or divide them further into smaller steps
